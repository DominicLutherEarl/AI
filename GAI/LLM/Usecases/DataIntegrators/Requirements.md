==== Problem ====
Summary : Connector generation & configuration.
Details : Integrating any functionality to a platform\standalone service currently requires a pre-configuration of the API endpoints, attributes, trust and additional settings as a template and as a customer instance. 
Different external (& internal) services leverage different protocols, formats, contract & standards for integration. 
Development & maintenance of these integrations (even with modern solutions) are one of the major resource-investments of R&D.

==== Proposed Solution ====
Train ML models or agents to auto-generate all the required scaffolding (template of API endpoints, attribute maps, trust fields, etc) and securely configure an integration with the customer's service tenant.
Ex: 
Step1: ML model or agent trains on the attribute structure of graph\scim\custom schemas of Entra\Salesforce\Workday integration endpoints
Step2: The Agent\ML model generates a default configuration to integrate with an IAM service leveraging standard IAM contracts such as SCIM or custom contracts of the IAM service provider.
Step3: Take as input, customer managed fields such as credentials, service-tenant-name, any filters or identifiers and store securely linked to above configurations.
Step4: Setup the integration operations as required (real-time\async) depending on the customer's usage traffic history.
